### MonoRepo for the project in CO2 WebDev module of a dynamic website. 

Team members: Mateusz Boratynski, Dmitri Moscoglo and Veit Brunnhuber. <br>
(Recent changes to the team were made. Initially Maharram Ismayilzada was also part of the team, but was excluded due to inactivity)

The idea for the Project/Website was to Crete a todo List organiser in a form of a web app.<br>
In addition of fulfilling all requirements, it also was a learning and challenge opportunity, so we went with it. 

The initial design/mock-up was done in Adobe XD. Initial prototype was a guide and rough representation of the idea.<br> 
It is missing some elements, but the details were never the point of this.<br>

Backend was written using Node.js as instructed. Express.js framework was used on top.<br>
As database persistency layer MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database was chosen.<br>
Additional frameworks and libraries used for the backend:
* Mongoose
* dotenv
* cors
* jsonwebtoken

Fronted implementation went with React.js. To make working with styling easier<br>
and avoid any miscommunication/misunderstanding a collection of prebuilt UI components MUI was used.<br>
List of all frameworks and libraries used for frontend/client side of the app:
* MUI material
* React.js
* axios 


#### Organisational approach.

The start of implementation was planned on August, since some learning/pickup was needed for some members of the team.<br>

To maintain the speed and consistency of development a project management software ClickUp was chosen.<br>
Everyone would write detailed assignment of the elements they were about to implement and assign those to themselves.<br>
This eliminated the need of frequent syncup meetings<br> 
and made clear who works on what and with whom you need to sync if there were conflicts/dependence on the feature you're working on.<br> 
Statuses of assignments made stagin and merging and reviewing branches easier. Special thanks to Mateusz for clearing this out.
